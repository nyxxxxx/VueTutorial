# This is a basic Vue tutorial with vite 4.0

### Before Starting
This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of HTML, JS, and CSS.

### Start
Install the necessary npm packages if this is the first time you start this example repository.
**Note: Node.js is required to be installed.**
```
cd your_path/VueTutorial
npm install
```
and then run ***npm run dev*** to start the server.
```
npm run dev
```
### Instructions
I will divide the tutorial into four weeks and post an overview of each week's content here.
Each week's tutorial takes about 30-60 minutes to complete, helping you understand Vue.js step by step.
Basically, we use new packages every week, so remember to run ***npm install*** again if ***npm run dev*** doesn't work.
